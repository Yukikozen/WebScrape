Am I doing it all wrong?,For the past year I've been working in Real Estate and I had luck with some deals", as the country I am living in is thriving right now. My issues as I heard from others is that I am being too humane with clients and I should learn how to take advantage of situations for my own purpose. I had clients spill their guts to me about issues they never spoke with anyone", I still speak with clients who I sold a property too on a weekly basis", they might call me to chat or even meet up for a coffee. I always try to build a connection with my clients", not only a business connection but also a kind of a connection that might resemble friendship. My biggest skill is making people talk about their problems and I have patience listening to them and I always enjoy when I can help my client in any way possible. So now I am really confused", as people have been telling me that I am being compassionate and that has no place in Real Estate. If I have to rip my clients off for my own advantage", I prefer to stop working in Real Estate. I am not the type of person who will lie or manipulate someone for monetary gain. Money is not the biggest enjoyment in my life", the biggest enjoyment in my life is helping the people who put their trust on me.,6,I would personally buy from you because you sound like a great person! I would not buy from the people giving you this ‘advice’.", Keep doing you. Ignore the haters. ?", Do you have a sense of how well the people criticizing you now are doing in comparison to you? Are their sales the same or better? Because if they are worse then you immediately know that their assessment of your situation is wrong.", Also", even if they are making better numbers now", how many bridges are they burning in the process? You'll tell three people tops about a good experience", you'll easily tell seven people about a bad experience. Also", how many seeds have you planted that you won't reap the benefit from for some time? How many of your clients bought a starter home this year", and in five years", will be ready to buy something bigger? Who are the coming back to? The realtor they know and trust or the guy that made them feel bad and used?", Some people get greedy and steal money from their future selves by being jerks today and squeezing people in the moment.", I will say", be careful and respect your personal boundaries and time. You can be kind", but you aren't anyone's parent or therapist.", I am in the US and tried being a real estate agent for a couple years or so. I never sold a single property and I lost a lot of my savings", but I learned some valuable things about myself and about the industry.", I realized that I am not a good fit for the real estate world for a variety of reasons. Some of which: First", I am not a competitive-natured person. Second", I have little or no patience for building relationships with people who I know just want to make money off of me. Third", I don't have a personality where people immediately like me (as many real estate agents do). Fourth", I am a straight-shooter and will call things as I see them", regardless of the consequences to me or a sale. For those (and probably other) reasons", I had difficulty in that field and eventually left it. But the lessons I learned were good ones", and I am glad I spent a couple years failing at being a real estate agent so I can take what I learned and succeed elsewhere.", Perhaps some of what I shared above will resonate with you. Perhaps you will find that you have certain qualities that I do not and you will be able to succeed where I could not. In any event", I wish you best of luck in your endeavors!", Thank you a lot for your input", I really appreciate it. Sorry that Real Estate did not work for you", but it's always better to leave the field instead of being miserable in a workplace you are not feeling satisfied by those around you. Have you found anything that you enjoy since then? By your wording it seems that you are a person who sees the opportunity to learn even if things are not going your way and as you said you use that to succeed elsewhere", so that is already a really good mindset to have.", I would argue you could probably be even more kinder and humane. Your sales will go through the roof.", You are on the path to getting a lot of referrals it would seem you should he good to stay as you are.", Never trade your values for someone else’s. This is how you do business", and so far it has been working just fine from what I read.", Your colleagues are focused on short term gains. The bit of extra money they can earn now with screwing customers over", is a direct plus. But they will never see those customers return", and will be bad mouthed by them for years to come.", You may leave a bit of money on the table with your approach", but your customers will run to you the moment they need help again", and will refer all their connections to you as well. You’re working on a long term plan and consistent income for years to come.", Keep doing what you’re doing! Honesty and kindness will always last longest.", I operate my business like this", too.

OpenAI just doesn't have the governance in place to wrangle a creative like Altman. Altman is single-minded on pushing the tech at the expense of all else", including not giving enough", or any", focus on even basic safety. He has the drive and know-how to help an arm of Microsoft", under their supervision", but he just doesn't have the same supports at OpenAI", where they'd either let him run the company into the ground or fire him", with no middle ground of trying to support his weaknesses and filling in the gaps", which is exactly what Microsoft can do that OpenAI just can't.", Doesn’t Microsoft only need to purchase 1.1 percent of open ai to have majority control?", As far as shares", Microsoft already is the majority shareholder. But control and shares are not linked with OpenAI", since its controlling authority is a nonprofit and the for-profit subsidiary which allows investors to invest is controlled solely by the nonprofit", which is not allowed to grant a profit to shareholders", legally. So", really", the board of the nonprofit has de facto power", regardless of who invests what.", So", when you have such a structure in place with an ambitious CEO who wants to increase profits and doesn't have anyone on the board that is equipped to challenge him as an actual advisor and/or mentor beyond just firing him", it's just not a situation that is conducive to the most successful of outcomes for either the company or that CEO. Altman going to Microsoft is really for everyone's benefit as Microsoft obviously does have the heavyweight governance and experienced tech leadership he needs to both keep him reined in as far as the safety aspect", but also allow him to drive product and profits according to his vision.

I'm thinking of launching a window cleaning business for its low overhead and attractive profit margins. I have some prior experience as a cleaner from about 10 years ago. To kickstart this", I've run the numbers and estimate needing around $5",000", excluding the essential expense of a truck", which I plan to buy with the profits from the first year. Initially", I would need someone with a truck", available to clean windows full-time in the first year. I'm seeking someone who needs a job", has a truck", and is eager to join me in building this business. While I won't be able to do the cleaning due to my existing job", I'll invest my spare time in sales and also help out with cleaning jobs on weekends. I'll handle administrative tasks", accounting", website management", and sales",but I need someone to be part of the sales team and take on the cleaning responsibilities initially. As the business grows", I envision you becoming the operations manager", managing/training the crew as we get more jobs. I'll continue handling the website", accounting", taxes", clients", and overall business management. I can teach you administrative skills and help you grow into a manager as the business expands. While I can't make promises about compensation", I'm committed to growing this into a successful company. I'm looking for someone as hungry for success as I am", willing to take this risk with me. I'd cover the launch expenses and dedicate a significant time commitment to sales. It's important that you understand the challenges in the early months", knowing that we might not make enough to live off initially. With a year's commitment", I believe we can scale this up to $100",000 each by the second year. Prospective partners would go through meetings to ensure the right fit. Once on board", they'd become part owners", potentially earning more initially due to their significant role. The structure", including compensation details", would be transparent", and I'd share the complete vision during the modeling process. Trust is crucial. I need someone honest", reliable", hardworking", and trustworthy. I want assurance that you won't compromise the business by drinking or getting high on the job", and that you'll show up consistently and won’t commit theft. If you're interested", I've created a revenue and expenses projection model.

In the beginning", I was always trying to push products and close deals. But I quickly realized that this approach was ineffective. People don't want to be sold to; they want to be helped. When I started focusing on building genuine relationships with my customers", my sales skyrocketed. I listened to their needs", answered their questions", and provided them with valuable information. As a result", they trusted me and were more likely to buy from me. So", if you're in sales", my advice to you is to forget about making sales and focus on building relationships.

It's nearly impossible to beat $15/day max at non fast food", and even if you can your diet will be awful. Even shit like breakfast sandwiches are $6 (and of all the things", that's the easiest cheap thing to make at home)", It’s still cheaper for a lot of people. When I was in college I ate a lot of little Caesar’s for $7.50", McDoubles were 2 for $3.89", rotteserie chickens from Sam’s club for $5", an entire XL pizza from Sam’s club for $10. I don’t pretend it’s healthier but I was dirty bulking and it got me to my 3500 daily calorie goal with less than $10 pretty much everyday. I lived alone and don’t enjoy eating week old meal prepped stuff so eating out was cheaper at the time compared to throwing food away.", That being said it’s not cheaper in the long term cause you’re going to have to pay a lot of medical bills eating that way but I did the math back then and for myself", it was cheaper. It will be very diet dependent though. If I wasn’t bulking I wouldn’t need 150g of protein daily and could just eat the cheapest items from grocery stores and in that scenario", groceries would be cheaper", What’s crazy is when I was in college (less than 10 years ago so I’m not that old) McDoubles were 2 for $2. And a mcchicken was also $1", If your single and want a lasagne", you’re better off hitting a restaurant.", Frozen lasagne seems like it got crazy expensive?

Additionally", if you value your time you need to value your health and cooking from home is usually leaps and bounds more healthy.", I can easily make a full meal worth 6 lunches or dinners in under 30 minutes and for less than $30. I can't even get that from fast food if I were to eat out.", I have made my own gyros it's ground beef ground pork. Take a pound of each. Onion", sessioning", bake in meatloaf pan", buy pack of wraps. For around $15 all in now", you can make many", many gyros. Forgot a few bucks for gyro sauce.", Yeah… umm.. no. It’s lamb. It’s oregano. Its marjoram. You can cheap out all you want but no thanks.", in what would is an $8.95 lunch cheaper than groceries?", the average amount people spend on the whole day on groceries is $10 lol", fuck there are so many stupid people in this sub", In Greece", gyros is normally made with pork", though other meats are used in other countries. Chicken is common", and lamb or beef may be found more rarely. Typical American mass-produced gyros are made with finely ground beef mixed with lamb. So if you are looking for authentic Gyros", pork is what they use ?", greek here. You have to go to specific places to get lamb in gyros when in Greece", it doesn't happen. Either pork or chicken", what you said. And it's way tastier than what you get in the US usually (i've lived in the US for 10 years)", Only in the US they use lamb in gyros. The actual greek gyros is either pork or chicken.", It's comparable in much of the world. Economies of scale", more people at the restaurant means you can charhe less and get bulk pricing on what you buy. If your eatery only makes a few similar dishes this way it could be worth the little extra money to save you all the time you would spend cooking.", There is the thing though", in the US at least its quite common to buy bulk and freeze. Heck I bought 10lbs of chicken wings for less then $2 a pound as they were on sale. In Germany if you told someone you just bought a 10lb bag of chicken wings they would probably say ""where are you shopping that you can get meat in the 10lb bags?!?!?"". This makes it really hard for restaurants to compete.", Heck", tonight I am having catfish", the filet was like $4", peppers and green beans were $5 and $4 respectively (and I won't even being getting close to using the entire bag)", and we got the main parts of a great meal that would easily be $18 at a local restaurant (and again left over green beans and peppers).", Between me and my wife we buy 40lb box of chicken wings($79) and another 40lb box of chicken leg quarters($22) every 3-4 months out of Restaurant Depot. Saves us fuck ton of money and the chicken is really good.", I don't think you understand. Its saying the prices have gone up way more than the prices of groceries.", Depending on what you're making it can be. There have been plenty of times I've spent $50 on food for a single meal at the grocery store. Often it's because you can only buy certain things in certain quantities", and I don't have every ingredient I need on hand all the time.", It's not apples to apples", though. I can obviously make tacos", spaghetti", or red beans and rice pretty cheap. But those also aren't the meals I order if I'm going out to eat. The expensive groceries tend to come if I'm trying to make a meal I'd normally get if I went out to eat.", ETA: I take that back. I order a la carte tacos all the time. Even in my HCOL place I can get a single taco for like $3-$4. Not much more than it would cost for me to buy all the ingredients.", Maybe in Malaysia and Thailand", Not at Texas Roadhouse apparently. You can get a sirloin entree for like $13.... anyone seen McDonald's prices lately?? Because it's hardly less than Roadhouse these days. Insane.", Heck yeah I’ll Texas Roadhouse all day over McDonalds. Plus you got all that delicious bread and butter:)", I feel for fast food though for a filling meal that Panda Express is my go to. I don’t do anything with a drive-thru anymore. Panda runs me $13-$14 for a “bigger plate” with 3 entrees", rice", veggies or chow Mein. Again this is for a filling meal", not a couple cheeseburgers at MCDonalds sort of thing. I usually only eat out like this 2 days a week. During the work week I’m all about food prepping for a few days.", Right? That's what I'm saying. Texas Roadhouse all the way!", Exactly...and if Texas Roadhouse is making good profits really makes you wonder...what’s McDonald’s profits with seriously over processed ‘food’....you know...like the ‘potatoes ‘ that McDonald’s buying from....the megalomaniac farms!……?", They just announced higher prices due to higher wage laws.

Also", you can then take out a margin loan on the stocks you own to finance other things", AND you can deduct the interest you pay for this loan on your taxes.", So yeah", truly rich people dont pay cash.", Well", it's a little more complicated than that. Rich people don't pay cash on consumable materials/depreciating assets. They most certainly pay cash for real estate - one of the great American tax loopholes.", Kinda. They don't pull cash out of their investments or bank accounts and they do use mortgages.", They take out a loan or line of credit against their existing assets to have cash on hand", then use that to buy the real estate. Then they mortgage the real estate to pay off the loan/line of credit. So they don't actually have to hold millions in cash in case they want to buy property", but can still make ""all cash offers.""", You don't really have to be truly rich to do that. You just need to have a brokerage account.", Now", I don't play with margin loans or anything like that", but I financed my truck for 48 months at 1.9% with my rebate as a down payment", so there's that. But anyone with good credit could have gotten that deal", and I've always had good credit", even at $15 per hour in the early aughts. There were literally zero income qualifications from Ford Credit", and my Expedition cost more than my first house for which I had a 30 years", 6.25% mortgage!", I bought my first stock share at 18 while working as a dish washer at a restaurant.", I don’t disagree.", The difference there is the “choice”. The real wealth choose to have interest for other benefits.", Ehh", you can get car loans at 3.99% right now.", This is still way less than the government takes from poor people.", Shut up", If your care about poor people you should wonder why you support sales tax. Prop tax. Water tax gas tax cell phone tax electricity tax trash tax municipal tax. These cost poor people way more.", It can be a lot more", a lot is left out. on utilities", yeah the large deposit but you are also probably chronically late and even if you dont get disconnected they add fees", if you get disconnected thats even more fees and they generally want the entire past due rather than one month.", laundry", having to go to a matt sucks", especially if waiting on a dryer that turns out to not be working and losing money to broken machines. the worse the neighborhood the worse the matts.", rents also tend to have fees if late. The poor often get tons of fees and those are always left off these studies.", stores are not only more expensive but further away and with less choices. yeah some people live near the store but similar density middle class neighborhoods have more stores.", whats also fun is companies like the cable company", you are past due and cant really afford it and ask to move to the lower tier so you can better pay your bill and they wont let you until you pay all you own despite you still have time left and if you dont pay it all before the next cycle well you get a new month at the old rate you got to pay off before they will allow you to use the lower tier.. they wont even help you get out of the cycle. Your best bet is to actually cancel", they will offer the same tier you got at a lower price", you will still have to pay past due but you wont have to worry about a charge coming in the mean time. and there is zero reason for that besides it does trap people at the higher rate who cant afford to pay off their full bill all at once. So you are trying to be more responsible and the company wont even let you.EDIT: FFS PEOPLE IM TALKING INTERNET which is needed for school and work in modern society. Of fucking course TV would be stupid if too poor. But net is something your kids need to do their fucking homework. SO fucking sorry i consider it a necessity which most fucking state govs do as well after covid. when i got spectrum they didnt have the lower tiers and i had more money", crazy what medical bills can do to people. Which is another thing", yeah no one ever got cable and THEN fell on bad times", nope they got it before they fell on bad times. FFS reddit.", You lost me at “cable company”.", Anyone who’s genuinely poor should not be spending on luxuries like cable TV. That’s an expensive and totally unnecessary purchase.", One year of cable tv is about the same as a basic washer/dryer set", if you really hate the “matt” that much.", Or", skip cable", continue to use the laundromat", and put the cable money in a Roth. $100/month for a couple decades is a retirement.", I have made six figures and never even considered buying cable. How retarded. Some people spend hundreds a month on TV.", And don't get me started on how the biggest flat screens I see are in rich houses and very ""poor"" houses.", cable isnt always tv", i have over the air tv. Cable is internet. spectrum. Which is needed for school. since internet work is frequently assigned. Kids cant do homework with no fucking net.", hate to break it to you", but cable is also a term for the net", which is needed for school", sorry but modern society and all >.. CRAZYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY. Kids cant do homework with no fucking net. SOrry but it is now a necessary utility in modern society. FFS I havent be able to afford cable tv. Its fucking insane when people with money think the poor cant poor. THat we are all overspending on luxuries rather than getting the bare min needed in society.", Isn’t that dollar generals business model", Canadian banks alone charge you monthly for being broke", In the US you can get no fee bank accounts now as many places want you to have cash sitting with them.", Ghetto Tax is a stupid way of describing the high cost of being poor.", 1) Obviously", poor credit will raise the cost of any loans you seek out", if you qualify at all.", 2) Poor credit can also raise your car insurance risk rating (even if you've never missed a payment for the insurance itself)", 3) Discount/dollar store items can often cost MORE than traditional retail adjusting for scale and size", 4) Overdraft fees", minimum deposit fees", or the dreaded payday lender 'fees' represent an interest rate in the hundreds", 5) Then there's the ""boots"" theory. A decent pair of work boots (as a proxy for any important and necessary purchase", such as a car) might cost $100 bucks but last for 5 years; a shitty pair might cost only $40 bucks but last 1 year tops.", Source: I work with low-income families.", Silver lining: Not many folks that the US has a national job training program that focuses on low income families. And in my area there are tons of attainable manufacturing jobs with good pay and benefits. The problem is NONE of the folks I work with are in position to take 6-8 weeks off from work (and life) to complete training.", The boots theory is mostly bullshit in the age of walmart and cheap chinese factories. Cheap goods are unbelievably cheap. Expensive goods are either 1) usually still sort of poorly made or 2) WAY more expensive. The 100 dollar boots last for less than 2 years", not 5. And the 500 dollar boots that last for 10 years need to be repaired every several years. A 300 dollar laptop will go obsolete years before an macbook", but costs 1/3rd the price.", I kept getting pissed my cheap vacuums were breaking after a year or two. Bought an expensive ass dyson. Still broke after 2.5 years. The replacement part cost more than the cheap ass ones I used to buy.", It's definitely not true for cars. An expensive car loses a ton of money in depreciation.", It's true for some stuff still", but less and less each year. Home improvement (or any type of good that requires a lot of labor to replace) is where its still true.", It’s still applicable", it’s just 99% of people are in the low income boots territory.", Most name brand products today are riding on the coattails of what they produced 40 years ago. Almost everything we buy is cheap chinese bullshit.", If you want top tier quality you almost need to hire someone to custom make it for you.", Could it be", maybe", that businesses just pass along the extra costs associated with higher security", theft and vandalism?", Groceries alone are much more expensive when your poor.", Not having a freezer means you can't stock up.", Not having extra cash/costco membership means you can't take advantage of sales.", In today's grocery prices that is easily 1000's per year spent because you couldn't shop strategically.", What a laughable figure", Economics of scale.", Living isn’t supposed to be easy or convenient. The world isn’t able to spoon feed you living cheaply and saving money intelligently.", When so many people use things like those check cashing services that charge 10% it becomes really hard for me to accept the normal excuse that society is the one fucking them over. When literally everyone can make a bank account that has direct deposit and remote deposit of checks", there’s absolutely no excuse for still losing 10% of your paycheck other than being literally intellectually disabled.", I’m not trying to disparage the poor", but where I work I drive past so many of those check cashing places and they have to be surviving somehow. It’s ridiculous to think anyone would use them when there are cheaper alternatives out there.", Why not just get a bank account? The real ghetto tax is insisting on living that way. It's a mentality of stupid choices more than anything. In past generations I get it - nobody new any better. But in 2023 there's a lil thing called the internet.", Youtube has millions of hours of videos on literally ANYTHING. You can learn to open a bank account. Learn to make a budget. Learn to invest for retirement. Learn to make repairs around the house. Hell MIT has its courses online for free - you could learn string theory & quantum mechanics were you so inclined.", Stop settling for ghetto. As douchey as Andrew tate and Jordan Peterson are", the part of their message about growing and learning and improving yourself is legit.", There's a solution for that: Don't be poor.", This is why you always make a payment plan instead of ignore with any bills.
https://old.reddit.com/r/business/comments/1813xfk/how_does_exported_japan_good_work/,How does exported japan good work?,Hi", I would like to start up my own business and have been very intrigued by the idea of a weekly drop shop. I myself have bought from such stores before and i need help understanding how it works. Essentially it is a website that offers new weekly drops of a variety of different goods", the stores I usually buy from have merchandise ranging from exclusive hair clips to god tier quality anime figures. I know for a fact that the merchandise they offer is original and rare and are being sold for reasonable (sometimes cheap) prices. I know they are exported from japan but where would i go about finding such good original merchandise? It is highly unlikely that the seller has time to go to japan every weekend or every month it would be too costly. Keep in mind both me and the store and middle eastern based. I thought maybe they buy from shopee because it is a cheap store", however you need an active japanese number number along with a japanese issued card (that you cannot top-op outside of japan) in order to make purchases. Any help would be greatly appreciated :),3,No Comment

https://old.reddit.com/r/business/comments/1810kw8/need_feedback/,Need Feedback,Hey", I'm working on this idea ... It's a subscription site for entrepreneurs", offering all sorts of digital tools like tutorials", templates", business trends", case studies and business guides for maybe $97 a year Think of it as a one-stop shop for business resources.I plan to offer a community as well", and I have been reaching out to mico content creators", and coaches to provide courses and content.I plan to offer a community as well", and I have been reaching out to mico content creators", and coaches to provide courses and content. As an entrepreneur", would this interest you? I'd love to get your thoughts on it!,3,If I was an entrepreneur", I would break it down structurally. To evaluate whether or not I need your service I would consider the following factors: 1. Is it helping me to grow my revenue? 2. Is it helping me to cut my cost? 3. Is it giving me any ideas to market my product better? 4. does it have insights on the industry I am catering to?", What most people misinterpret is real entrepreneurs do not need basic content which could explain the basics of business since they have already initiated and are trying to achieve a certain goal. If you’re trying to cater just the basics of business & entrepreneurship. Then your market is not entrepreneurs. They are normal people looking to start their side hustle or to become entrepreneurs In which case a one-time purchase is more likely than a subscription model.", I think it's not a bad idea", esp creating a community where people can share ideas. You could automate lots of things to make it easier", As an entrepreneur", I can see the value in a subscription site like this. Having access to a variety of digital tools and resources in one place can be very convenient and cost-effective. The community aspect also adds a lot of value", as being able to connect with other entrepreneurs and experts can provide valuable support and networking opportunities. I think it's important to ensure that the content and resources offered are high-quality and relevant to the needs of entrepreneurs. It's also great that you are reaching out to micro content creators and coaches to provide diverse perspectives and expertise. Overall", I think this could be a valuable resource for entrepreneurs", especially if the price point is reasonable and the content is consistently updated and relevant. Good luck with your venture!
